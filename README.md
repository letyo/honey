My first more serious website. I have learned lots of things, and I just wanted to put them together, see how it works.

This is a website of an imaginary honey-producing company. There is for example a simple dropdown menu (CSS), an accordion (jQuery) and a contact form (PHP).

It's a little bit too yellow, but my goal was rather the back-end (and try out some methods) than the front-end. And you know, the bees and the honey are yellow too. :)
